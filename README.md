# Poopy Taters

An `hello world` sandbox for exploring [react](https://reactjs.org).

## Tests

I wrote a couple tests using both [react-test-renderer](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html) and [enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme. Both have issues, but are definitely usable.

## Doot!

Clone it and run `npm test`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
